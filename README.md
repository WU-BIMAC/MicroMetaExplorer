# MicroMetaExplorer

MicroMetaExplorer is a key component of the **Micro-Meta** project, designed to facilitate the comparison and exploration of Microscope-Hardware JSON files generated by the **Micro-Meta App**. This tool provides an intuitive interface to visualize and analyze microscope hardware configurations in a tabular format, enabling users to filter, compare, and identify microscopes with specific characteristics.

## Features

- **Explore Microscope-Hardware JSON Files**: Load and explore JSON files stored in the Home folder, which contain detailed hardware configurations of microscopes.
- **Filter by Hardware Characteristics**: Easily filter microscopes based on specific hardware attributes (e.g., find all microscopes equipped with a 100x Objective).
- **Compare Microscopes Side-by-Side**: Select multiple microscopes to compare their hardware configurations in a detailed, side-by-side view.
- **Identify Desired Configurations**: Quickly identify microscopes that meet your specific microscopy requirements.


## How It Works

1. **Load JSON Files**: MicroMetaExplorer scans the Home folder for Microscope-Hardware JSON files generated by the Micro-Meta App.
2. **Filter and Explore**: Use the filtering options to narrow down the list of microscopes based on specific hardware characteristics.
3. **Compare Configurations**: Select microscopes of interest to compare their hardware configurations in a tabular format.
4. **Launch Micro-Meta App**: Easily launch the Micro-Meta App viewer for visualizing and editing the identified Microscope-Hardware file.
